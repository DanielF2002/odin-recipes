    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This dish uses oranges with haddock which is a change from most dishes that use lemon with fish or seafood. It's a nice refreshing change. It pairs well with veggies, like asparagus, broccoli, or zucchini. For starch you could do mashed or roasted potatoes, risotto or couscous.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound haddock fillets</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt-free seasoning blend (such as Mrs. Dash®)</li>
        <li>2 oranges, zested and juiced</li>
        <li>¾ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons buttery spread (such as Smart Balance®), melted</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried parsley</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground thyme</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Arrange haddock fillets in a large baking dish. Season with salt-free seasoning blend. Pour orange juice over fish and cover with plastic wrap, reserve orange zest. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Stir panko bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, buttery spread, parsley, thyme, and reserved orange zest in a bowl until well mixed. Press crumb mixture over haddock.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until fish is easily flaked with a fork and topping is golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow fish to rest 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
